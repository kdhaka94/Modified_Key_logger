# Modified_Key_logger
This Key logger is designed fully for educational purposes and to show you how and what can any other person do with your computer. Sorry i didn't wrote any comments in the program but its pretty simple to understand..... 

To compile it you need to enable C++11 standards and -mwindows flag

The Keylogger is able to capture all the keystrokes using system hooks. In addition to this, it is also able to put them into a file, encrypt the file and send the file via mail based on a timer...

And on the first start the program will move itself to the windows startup folder and then every time the computer will start the program will also start...
